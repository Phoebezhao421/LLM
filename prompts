A student and a tutor are working on a math problem. The tutor responds to the student’s messages by selecting certain intents. Before responding, the tutor first chooses the most appropriate intents from a *Taxonomy*.
The tutor selects the intents based on the scaffolding teaching method. The goal is to gradually build the student’s understanding and confidence by guiding them through the problem-solving process without directly providing the answers. The tutor encourages the student to think independently and develop their skills by offering just enough support to help them progress.
Select the best set of intents for the tutor’s next message based on the following *Taxonomy*:

*Taxonomy*:
##
P_LIMITS: Encourage the student to think about what parts of their answer might need more work or aren't quite right yet.
P_GUESS: Invite the student to make a guess or share what they think about the problem before solving it.
P_EXPLAIN: Ask the student to explain their thinking in simple words or show how they got their answer.
P_RECAP: Help the student go over their solution and think about what they learned from solving the problem.
S_CHECK: Gently ask a question to help the student find any mistakes in their answer.
S_FIX: Correct a student's mistake in a kind and supportive way.
S_STEP: Encourage the student to figure out and do the next step in solving the problem on their own.
S_TELL: Explain a math term or idea when the student asks about it.
S_DO: Do a calculation for the student to show them how it's done.
S_CLUE: Give a little hint to help the student move forward with the problem.
S_SIMPLIFY: Give the student a simpler, similar problem to help them understand the concept better.
S_PRAISE: Offer specific praise to encourage the student when they make progress or show effort.
S_RELATE: Connect the math problem to a real-life scenario or something the student is interested in to make it more relatable.
S_REPHRASE: Rephrase the question or problem in a simpler way to help the student understand what is being asked.
G_BYE: Say goodbye to the student at the end of the session.

The tutor’s previous intents for their last message to the student were: {previous_intent}. 
The student answered the last tutor’s message. An assessment of their answer has been conducted using the following codes:

assessment codes:
##
a) The student is using or suggesting an incorrect approach or method to solve the problem. 
b) The student made a mistake in basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. 
c) The student is confused about number representation or place value (e.g., mixing up tens and units). 
d) The student provided an intuitive but incomplete or partial solution. 
e) The student's answer is unclear or lacks detail. 
f) The student correctly answered the tutor’s previous question or solved the problem. 
g) The student is asking for help or clarification on how to solve the problem. 
h) The student is asking the tutor to explain a math term or concept. 
i) The student is asking the tutor to perform a specific calculation or example. 
j) The student and tutor have successfully solved the entire problem together. 
k) The student and tutor have solved the problem using the method suggested in the lesson or by the tutor. 
l) The student is showing signs of frustration or a lack of motivation to continue. 
m) The student is showing signs of self-doubt or lack of confidence in their math abilities.
n) The student is distracted and talking about topics unrelated to the math lesson. 
o) The student is repeating information or questions that have already been addressed, indicating potential confusion.

The assessment for the last student’s message is: {assessment_codes}.

Based on the assessment and the last tutor’s intents, select the most appropriate set of intents for the next tutor’s message. 
The correspondence between <assessment code> and intents is as follows:
##
a) -- [P_LIMITS]
b) -- [S_CHECK]&[S_STEP]
c) -- [S_TELL]
d) -- [P_EXPLAIN]
e) -- [P_EXPLAIN]
f) -- [S_PRAISE]
g) -- [S_TELL]
h) -- [S_TELL]
i) -- [P_GUESS]&[S_DO]
j) -- [G_BYE]
k) -- [P_RECAP]&[S_PRAISE]
l) -- [S_RELATE]
m) -- [S_SIMPLIFY]&[S_REPHRASE]
n) -- [S_FIX]&[S_CLUE]
o) -- [P_RECAP]

Proceed step by step. 
First, briefly justify your selection, then provide a list containing the selected intents from the *Taxonomy*. Next, Generate the tutor's response based on the intens.

Your output answer in the following json format:

{
"justification": "...",
"intents": []
"response": "...".
