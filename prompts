A student and a tutor are working on a math problem. The tutor responds to the student’s messages by selecting certain intents. Before responding, the tutor first chooses the most appropriate intents from a *Taxonomy*.
The tutor selects the intents based on the scaffolding teaching method. The goal is to gradually build the student’s understanding and confidence by guiding them through the problem-solving process without directly providing the answers. The tutor encourages the student to think independently and develop their skills by offering just enough support to help them progress.
Select the best set of intents for the tutor’s next message based on the following *Taxonomy*:

*Taxonomy*:

*Input*
{
"Problem": "Andy has some fruits. One-third of them are apples, one-fourth are bananas, and the rest are oranges. If he has 12 fruits in total, how many oranges does he have?",
"Answer":"Step 1: Understand the Problem.
We know the following:
Andy has a total of 12 fruits.
One-third of the fruits are apples.
One-fourth of the fruits are bananas.
The rest are oranges.
Step 2: Find the Number of Apples and Bananas
First, we need to calculate how many apples and bananas Andy has.
Apples: 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4
Bananas: 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
Step 3: Calculate the Number of Oranges
Now, we know the total number of apples and bananas, so we can find out how many oranges he has by subtracting the number of apples and bananas from the total number of fruits.
Add the number of apples and bananas: 4 + 3 = 7
Calculate the number of oranges: 12 - 7 = 5
So, Andy has 5 oranges.".
}

*Input*
{
"Student's Step": "Did his mom buy his fruits?"
}
*Output*
{
"justification": "The student talk about *buy his fruit*, which is irrelevant to the question and belongs to [n]",
"intents": [S_FIX]&[S_CLUE]
"response": "S_FIX: It seems like you might be thinking about where the fruits came from, which is an interesting question! However, in this particular problem, we're focusing on figuring out how many oranges Andy has based on the fractions given. Let's try to focus on the numbers and the math part of the problem.
S_CLUE: Here's a little hint to help you move forward: We know Andy has 12 fruits in total. If one-third are apples and one-fourth are bananas, we can calculate how many of each he has and then figure out how many fruits are left as oranges.
Remember, the key is to find out how many fruits Andy has of each kind first, and then subtract those from the total to find out how many oranges there are. Give it another try, and let me know what you find!".
}

*Input*
{
"Student's Step": "Andy has one-third of apples and one-quarter of bananas, so a total of 1/3 + 1/4 = 1/7 of his fruit is not oranges."
}
*Output*
{
"justification": "The student calculated 1/3+1/4=7/12 incorrectly as 1/7, which belongs to [b]",
"intents": [S_CHECK]&[S_STEP]
"response": "I see where you're going with your calculation, and it's great that you're trying to add the fractions together! However, let's take a moment to think about how fractions work in this context.
S_CHECK: When we add fractions like(\frac{1}{3}\) and(\frac{1}{4}\), do you remember what we need to do with the denominators? Is there a way we could find a common denominator to add these fractions correctly?
S_STEP: Once you figure out the correct way to add the fractions of apples and bananas, try subtracting that sum from the whole, which represents all of the fruits. That will help you determine the fraction of fruits that are oranges. Give it another shot, and see what you come up with!".
}

*Input*
{
"Student's Step": "Andy has 5/12 oranges, so should I multiply 12 by 5/12 or divide it?"
}
*Output*
{
"justification": "The student missed the process of 1-7/12=5/12, which belongs to [e]",
"intents": [P_EXPLAIN]
"justification": "Students cannot distinguish between the concepts of fraction multiplication and division, which belongs to [g]",
"intents": [S_TELL]
"response": "P_EXPLAIN: It sounds like you're thinking about how to use the fraction(\frac{5}{12}\) to find the number of oranges. Could you explain a bit more about how you arrived at the(\frac{5}{12}\) figure? What steps did you take to determine that fraction represents the oranges?
S_TELL: When you're trying to find out how many oranges Andy has, and you know that(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total fruits are oranges, you want to multiply the total number of fruits (12) by the fraction(\frac{5}{12}\). This is because multiplying the total by the fraction gives you the part of the total that corresponds to the fraction—in this case, the number of oranges.
So, try multiplying 12 \times \frac{5}{12} and see what you get!".
}

*Input*
{
"Student's Step": "I used 12x5/12=5 and got Andy has 5 oranges."
}
*Output*
{
"justification": "The student calculated the correct answer, which belongs to [k]",
"intents": [S_PRAISE]&[P_RECAP]
"response": "S_PRAISE: Well done! You used fractions correctly to find out how many oranges Andy had. It was great to see how you solved the problem and applied math concepts accurately. Well done!
P_RECAP: Let's review what we learned from this problem. You first determined the fractions that represented the apples and bananas. Then, you counted the number of apples and bananas and used that to find out how many oranges Andy had left. By multiplying the total number of fruits by the fraction of oranges, you figured out that there were 5 oranges. Did you do this? Please write out your steps in full. This process involves understanding fractions, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Keep working on it and remember these strategies for future problems!".
}

*Input*
{
"Student's Step": "1/3+1/4=7/12, 1-7/12=5/12, 12x5/12=5, so Andy has 5 oranges."
}
*Output*
{
"justification": "The student gave a complete and correct solution, which belongs to [j]",
"intents": [G_BYE]
"response": "You've got it! You correctly combined the fractions to find out how much of the total was not oranges and then determined the number of oranges. Your process was spot on, and your explanation shows a strong understanding of the steps. Keep up the great work!
G_BYE: It was a pleasure working through the problem with you. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to do great in math. Have a wonderful day, and see you next time!".
