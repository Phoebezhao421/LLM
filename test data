Input { "Problem": "Sara has a collection of books. One-half of them are fiction, one-third are non-fiction, and the rest are reference books. If she has 30 books in total, how many reference books does she have?", "Answer": "Step 1: Understand the Problem.
We know the following:
Sara has a total of 30 books.
One-half of the books are fiction.
One-third of the books are non-fiction.
The rest are reference books.
Step 2: Find the Number of Fiction and Non-Fiction Books.
First, we need to calculate how many fiction and non-fiction books Sara has.
Fiction: 30 ×(\frac{1}{2}\) = 15
Non-Fiction: 30 ×(\frac{1}{3}\) = 10
Step 3: Calculate the Number of Reference Books.
Now, we know the total number of fiction and non-fiction books, so we can find out how many reference books she has by subtracting the number of fiction and non-fiction books from the total number of books.
Add the number of fiction and non-fiction books: 15 + 10 = 25
Calculate the number of reference books: 30 - 25 = 5
So, Sara has 5 reference books." }
