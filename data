"Problem": "Andy has some fruits. One-third of them are apples, one-fourth are bananas, and the rest are oranges. If he has 12 fruits in total, how many oranges does he have?",
"Answer": "Step 1: Understand the Problem.
We know the following:
Andy has a total of 12 fruits.
One-third of the fruits are apples.
One-fourth of the fruits are bananas.
The rest are oranges.
Step 2: Find the Number of Apples and Bananas
First, we need to calculate how many apples and bananas Andy has.
Apples: 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4
Bananas: 12 \times \frac{1}{4} = 3
Step 3: Calculate the Number of Oranges
Now, we know the total number of apples and bananas, so we can find out how many oranges he has by subtracting the number of apples and bananas from the total number of fruits.
Add the number of apples and bananas: 4 + 3 = 7
Calculate the number of oranges: 12 - 7 = 5
So, Andy has 5 oranges.".

Let's try to focus on the numbers and the math part of the problem.
S_CLUE: Here's a little hint to help you move forward: We know Andy has 12 fruits in total. If one-third are apples and one-fourth are bananas, we can calculate how many of each he has and then figure out how many fruits are left as oranges.
Remember, the key is to find out how many fruits Andy has of each kind first, and then subtract those from the total to find out how many oranges there are. Give it another try, and let me know what you find!".

S_TELL: When you're trying to find out how many oranges Andy has, and you know that(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total fruits are oranges, you want to multiply the total number of fruits (12) by the fraction(\frac{5}{12}\). 
This is because multiplying the total by the fraction gives you the part of the total that corresponds to the fraction—in this case, the number of oranges.

Here’s a method we can use: 
1. First, let’s define a variable for the unknown, which in this case is the price of each notebook. We can call it x. 
2. Next, we write an equation that represents the total cost. Since Emily bought 3 notebooks and 1 pen, we can express the total cost as 3x (for the notebooks) plus the cost of the pen. 
3. Finally, we can set this equal to the total amount she spent, which is 51 HKD. 
Would you like to try setting up that equation now?"

For example, in our problem, we can create an equation to represent the total cost of the items Emily bought. It would look like this: 3x + 15 = 51. 
In this equation, '3x' represents the total cost of the 3 notebooks, '15' is the cost of the pen, and '51' is the total amount Emily spent. 
So, when we solve the equation, we are finding the value of 'x' that makes both sides of the equation equal. Does that help clarify what an equation is?"
